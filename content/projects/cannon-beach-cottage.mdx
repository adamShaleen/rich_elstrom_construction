## Green Details

The wood used in this home is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified. Learn more at [www.fscus.org](https://www.fscus.org). The wood, being FSC, was tracked by a chain of command from the time it was harvested until it arrived at our building site. All processes are environmentally friendly, from the logger, to the hauler, to the mill.

The foundation of this house is made of Durisol blocks. They are made out of recycled wood chips, Portland cement, and rock-wool insulation. The product comes from Canada. To learn more, visit [www.durisolbuild.com](https://www.durisolbuild.com).
