This custom home, designed by Nathan Good, Architect, showcases net-metering capabilities—generating sufficient power to meet household needs while selling excess energy back to the utility company.

## Eco Roof System

The vegetative roof was innovative for the Cannon Beach area. It incorporates a membrane system, specialized soil, and native plantings like wild strawberries. Benefits include natural cooling, reduced stormwater runoff, and aesthetic appeal to neighboring properties uphill.

## Solar Power Systems

The main residence features solar panels that enable net metering, where generated power exceeds consumption.

Additional installations include:

- A 1.3 kW residential system in Gearhart designed for potential expansion
- Strategic panel placement using a "solar pathfinder" tool to optimize sun exposure
- A Sunnyboy converter enabling owners to monitor real-time power generation
- Flexible mounting solutions accommodating various roof slopes and configurations

## Technical Achievement

The project demonstrates that whether a house is big or small, whether the roof is steeply sloped or gently curved, a solar solution can be a great source of green energy and cost reduction.

The construction team employed integrated design methods to achieve the goal of a home producing more energy than it consumed.
